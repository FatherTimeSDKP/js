# What is a Soulbound Token

Let’s first understand what a Soulbound Token (SBT) is:

A **Soulbound Token** is a unique digital asset that cannot be transferred to another wallet. Once minted, it remains permanently tied to the owner’s wallet—perfect for credentials, achievement badges, or any on-chain proof of identity.

## How to make your tokens Soulbound or Non-Transferrable

The easiest way is via the **Permissions** tab on your thirdweb contract dashboard. For a visual walkthrough, check out our [guide on making NFTs non-transferable](https://blog.thirdweb.com/guides/make-your-nft-non-transferable/?utm_source=dc).

If you prefer using the **Explorer**, follow these steps:

1. **Connect your wallet**  
   Ensure your wallet is connected to the Dashboard/Explorer and set to the same network as your contract.

2. **Select the correct network**  
   Verify the network selector (top-right) matches your contract’s deployment chain (e.g., Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli).

3. **Open the Explorer**  
   In the thirdweb Dashboard, select your contract and switch to the **Explorer** tab.

4. **Choose `revokeRole` under write**  
   The `revokeRole` function requires two inputs: **Role** and **Account**.

5. **Convert `TRANSFER_ROLE` to bytes32**  
   Use a [keccak256 tool](https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/keccak_256.html) to hash the string `TRANSFER_ROLE`, then prefix with `0x`.  
   For example:  
   `0x8502233096d909befbda0999bb8ea2f3a6be3c138b9fbf003752a4c8bce86f6c`

6. **Set the account to the zero address**  
   Enter `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to revoke transfer rights from every wallet.

7. **Confirm the on-chain transaction**  
   Click “write” and approve the transaction in your wallet.  
  
   <DocImage src={Soulbound} />

8. **Verify in Permissions**  
   Refresh the **Permissions** tab to confirm that `TRANSFER_ROLE` is revoked for the zero address.  
  
   <DocImage src={Permissions} />

That’s it—your tokens are officially soulbound!
