# Issue linking device on the authorization page via Thirdweb CLI

Encountering issues when linking a new device via the authorization page.

### Error

How to authorize your account using `secretKey` for the thirdweb CLI

### Solution

You can authorize the CLI with a `secretKey` in just a couple of steps:

1. **Get your `secretKey`**  
   Head over to the thirdweb dashboard and generate a key: https://thirdweb.com/team/~/~/.

2. **Deploy with your `secretKey`**  
   Run the following command: `npx thirdweb deploy -k secretKey`

3. **Use the same pattern for other commands**  
   You can also use other methods like `upload`, `publish`, and `build` using the same format:  
   - `npx thirdweb upload -k secretKey`  
   - `npx thirdweb publish -k secretKey`  
   - `npx thirdweb build -k secretKey`

Thatâ€™s it! The CLI will now use your `secretKey` to authenticate every command.
