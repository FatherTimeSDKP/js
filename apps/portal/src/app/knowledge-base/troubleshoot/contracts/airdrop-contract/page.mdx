# Airdrop Contract Troubleshooting

Airdropping NFTs to your community is a popular way to provide utility in many NFT-based projects. Using the [airdrop contracts](https://thirdweb.com/explore/airdrop), you can airdrop any ERC20, ERC721, or ERC1155 tokens.

To get started, here is a quick overview of how to airdrop NFTs:

- Deploy your NFT/token contract and mint tokens  
- Deploy the airdrop contract  
- Approve the airdrop contract in your NFT contract via `approve` or `setApprovalForAll`. We recommend `setApprovalForAll` for large airdrops so you don’t need to approve each token ID individually.  
- Enter your NFT/token parameters into the airdrop contract’s `airdrop` function and execute

Note: We recommend testing the airdrop contract with a small number of tokens on **testnet** before executing the full airdrop on mainnet.

If you encounter an error after following these steps, verify the following:

- You have enough funds in your wallet to cover gas fees  
- The airdrop contract has been granted approval on the NFT contract. See the example below:  

 <DocImage src={setApproval} />

- Your airdrop parameters use the correct formatting:  
  - **recipients** must be an array of quoted addresses: `["0x...","0x...","0x..."]`  
  - **token ID** must be an array of numeric IDs: `[0,1,2]`

## Common Airdrop Issues

1. NFTs aren’t minted/claimed  
2. Trying to airdrop too many NFTs at once  
3. Airdropping NFTs to invalid wallet addresses

**NFTs aren’t minted/claimed**  
Make sure you’ve minted the NFTs to your wallet first. You can only airdrop tokens you already own.

**Trying to airdrop too many NFTs at once**  
Most chains limit a single transaction to around 100 recipients. Split large lists into batches of 100 addresses or fewer.

**Airdropping NFTs to invalid wallet addresses**  
If you see `execution reverted: ERC1155: transfer to non ERC1155Receiver implementer`, one or more addresses in your list aren’t valid ERC1155 recipients. Remove any invalid addresses and try again.
