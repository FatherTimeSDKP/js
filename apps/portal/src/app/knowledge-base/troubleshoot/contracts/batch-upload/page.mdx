# Batch Upload Issues

Uploading large amounts of media for your drop contracts can sometimes fail. This guide will help you identify and resolve the most common causes.

## Common Causes

### 1. Oversized batches  
Although our batch uploader technically supports up to 25 GB, we recommend splitting large uploads into smaller chunks—ideally 100 MB per batch, and no more than 1–2 GB at a time. If you still see errors, try uploading just 2–3 files as a quick test.

### 2. Network interference  
- **VPNs** can interrupt your connection—disable any active VPN during uploads.  
- **Ad blockers** may block necessary requests—turn them off temporarily.  
- **Anti-virus software** can also interfere—pause it while you upload.

## Best Practices

- Aim for 100 MB batches when possible.  
- Keep each batch upload under 10 minutes to avoid timeout.  
- Test with a small batch of 2–3 files to verify your setup before larger uploads.
