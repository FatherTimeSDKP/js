## üß¨ Overview: What This Is

This repository presents a **unified physical‚Äìcomputational framework** combining:

- **Scale, Density, Kinematics, Shape, and Causality**
- **Wavelet compression, orbital dynamics, and NP-complete logic**
- Into a single, interpretable system of **time, mass, and reality**

It proposes a candidate **post-quantum theory of physical compression**, verified on-chain and structured as six core modules:

| Framework | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `SDVR` | Defines **time** as a function of scale, density, velocity, rotation |
| `SDKP` | Derives **mass** from shape‚Äìdensity‚Äìkinematic scaling |
| `SD&N` | Encodes **particle identity** via shape, dimension, number |
| `EOS` | Maps orbital systems to test time‚Äìmass dynamics |
| `QCC` | Formalizes **causal compression** and entropy minimization |
| `CWT` | Provides **time-causal multiscale signal analysis**
